<!-- I chose HTML5 as the fifteenth project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/AquariOS) as HTML is one of the main documentation lanuages used in this project. It is used for some usage alongside markdown and its documentation. I also wanted to have a project language file represent it. !-->
